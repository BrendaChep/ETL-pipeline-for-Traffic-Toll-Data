 This project is the implementation of a data pipeline using Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, and MySQL. It involves extracting data from multiple sources in various formats (csv, tsv) and consolidating it into a single file. To stream the data in real-time, I utilized Apache Kafka, and then ingested it into a Python data pipeline for transformation. Finally, the transformed data was loaded into a MySQL database, allowing for further exploration and analysis. This  project showcases my ability to work with different tools and technologies, as well as my skills in data extraction, transformation, and loading.
